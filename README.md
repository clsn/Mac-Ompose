Mac-Ompose
==========

Compose key on Mac OS X.

Used almost daily on 10.10.3 (Yosemite).
Feel free to contact me if you have any issues.

Installation
------------

  * Install Karabiner from https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/
  * Run `./install.sh`
  * Karabiner Preferences window on `Change Key` tab
    enable `Send F13 for Right Command (Mac-Ompose)`

Hacking
-------

If you want to hack more, have a look into misc directory.

Gotchas
-------

It generally works, but in applications that eat the `<F13>` key
(like MacVim or iTerm) it does not work. If you have any ready
solutions, please let me know.
